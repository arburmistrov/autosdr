Subject: GenAI workshop idea for {company_name}

Hi {first_name},

I am reaching out because your role in {company_name} looks closely tied to {why_fit}.

We run a senior-level AI Prototyping and Execution Workshop where we:
- identify high-impact business/operational use cases,
- validate options through live prototyping,
- assess architecture, security, and governance implications,
- leave the team with clear next steps.

A potential starting point for your context: {ai_use_case_hypothesis}.

If relevant, we can do a short 20-minute fit check and confirm if this is worth a full session.

If now is not a priority, reply "not now" and I will not follow up.

Best regards,
{sender_name}
